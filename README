Ongle is the starts of a very basic scripting language for the CLR.

Created for my amusement!

Basic features of Ongle are :

- Ongle is a dynamic language.
- There are no methods, just closures.
- Closures cannot return values. Thus all code must pass on their values to closures that are passed in. This encourges development in a Continuation Passing Style. There are many interesting features of this style, most notably the ability to make all calls asynchronous.

There is hardly any syntax.

To assign a variable :

x = 3
y = 'hello world'

To output to the console :

print 'hello world' + newline

To create a closure :

printstuff = {
	print 'yay' + newline
}

To call a closure :

x (parameter1, parameter2)

Currently a closures parameters are passed in the '$' variable. They are accessed like :

dostuff = {
	print $[0]
	print $[1]
}
